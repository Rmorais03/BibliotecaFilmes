# C# Console Application - University Project

## Overview
This is a C# console application developed as part of a course assignment at **ESTGV** (School of Technology and Management of Viseu), during my **first year of the TDM (Technologies of Multimedia) Bachelor's degree**. The project was implemented entirely by myself and serves as an example of my programming skills and understanding of C# fundamentals.

## Features
- Console-based user interface for simplicity and clarity.
- Implements core concepts learned in the course, including:
  - Basic input/output operations
  - Conditional statements
  - Loops
  - Functions and modular code design
- Fully commented code to improve readability and maintainability.

## Requirements
- **.NET 6.0 SDK** (or later)
- Compatible with Windows, Linux, and macOS with .NET runtime installed.
